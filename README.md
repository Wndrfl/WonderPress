## Setup
Wonderpress comes with a super basic CLI to help you interact with the various developer tools it provides. The CLI will help you do everything from setting up the WordPress installation to "sniffing" your code against the WordPress Standards.

To access the Wonderpress CLI, navigate to the root of the project and enter the following in your terminal:

```
$ sh wonderpress
```
You will be prompted with:
